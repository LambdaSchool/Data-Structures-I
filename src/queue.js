  1. Add a constructor with a storage structure; there are multiple options you could use for this
  2. Add a size getter that returns the number of items the queue is storing
  3. Add an `enqueue` method that accepts an item as input and adds it to the storage structure
  4. Add a `dequeue` method that removes the item in the queue that was added earliest
